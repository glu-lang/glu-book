The GLU Language is a low-level programming language designed to unify projects written in various languages. It offers a stable ABI to decompile different languages into GLU's modern and intuitive syntax. This ensures seamless integration and easier maintenance of diverse codebases. GLU aims to simplify cross-language development, making it more efficient and accessible for developers.
